TODO--------------

-what if tokens are the same?

-case4: is it possible to change the ERC20 so you dont need the swap contract on both sides?

-can we just keep one contract on the BC ? that's generic for all users?

-be critical on if it is actually atomic.
>what about the order that the contracts are put on the blockchain?
>what about the order that the transactions are put on the blockchain? if A or B is a miner or both (since they have influence on it)





DONE--------------

-show only the core! smallest possible

-is the timeout really neccessary?
